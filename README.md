What is one thing JavaScript can do that HTML/CSS cannot?
JavaScript can handle logic and interactivity (e.g., processing form data, storing values in arrays, calculating averages, responding dynamically to user events).

Why do we prefer const by default?
Because it prevents reassignment, reduces accidental bugs, and makes code more predictable and maintainable.

What is the difference between == and ===?
== compares values with type coercion.
=== compares both value and type without coercion (strict equality).
We prefer === for safer comparisons.

What was the most useful Console command today (and why)?
console.table() — because it displays arrays/objects in a structured table format, making debugging data much clearer.

CSS hover vs JS hover: which felt more robust and why?
CSS hover felt more robust because it is simpler, declarative, and requires less code. It handles visual effects efficiently without extra scripting logic.
